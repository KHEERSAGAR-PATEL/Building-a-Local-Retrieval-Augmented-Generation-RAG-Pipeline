### README: RAG Pipeline Implementation from Scratch

---

### **Project Title**  
**Building a Local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline from Scratch**

---

### **Description**  

This project demonstrates how to build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline from scratch and run it on a local GPU. The RAG pipeline combines retrieval-based techniques with generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to answer questions based on an input document. 

The goal is to create a modular, transparent pipeline that processes **PDF documents**, enables question-answering over the content, and customizes every component for greater control over functionality.  

Instead of relying on high-level frameworks like [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) or [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/), this implementation prioritizes **customizability** and **inspectability**. It is particularly useful for understanding the underlying mechanisms of RAG workflows.

### **Features**  

1. **PDF Processing**:  
   - Extracts and preprocesses text from PDF documents.  
   - Converts unstructured text into a searchable format for later retrieval.

2. **Document Indexing and Retrieval**:  
   - Embeds and indexes the text using vectorization techniques (e.g., embeddings like BERT or sentence transformers).  
   - Retrieves relevant document sections based on user queries.

3. **Query and Response Handling**:  
   - Queries are processed and relevant document sections are fed into an LLM for generation.  
   - Combines the retrieved content with the LLM’s generative power for accurate answers.

4. **End-to-End Workflow**:  
   - Custom-built pipeline for preprocessing, retrieval, and generation.  
   - Runs locally, leveraging GPU for efficient processing.

5. **Flexibility for Customization**:  
   - Fully configurable pipeline components, from the retrieval mechanism to the LLM integration.  
   - Easy to extend for additional use cases or datasets.

### **Setup Instructions**  

1. **Prerequisites**:  
   - Python 3.8+  
   - GPU-enabled system with CUDA drivers installed  
   - Libraries: PyTorch, TensorFlow, transformers, sentence-transformers, PyPDF2, and others as specified in `requirements.txt`

2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Pipeline**:  
   - Place your PDF file in the `data/` directory.  
   - Open the notebook `rag_pipeline.ipynb`.  
   - Follow the steps to extract content, index documents, and interact with the RAG pipeline.

4. **Configurations**:  
   - Modify `config.py` for settings like embedding model, LLM model, and retrieval parameters.

### **Usage Example**  

1. Open a PDF (e.g., a technical paper).  
2. Query: *“What is the main conclusion of the study?”*  
3. Response: The RAG pipeline retrieves relevant sections and generates an answer based on the LLM's understanding.

### **Technical Details**  

- **Text Extraction**: Preprocesses PDFs with libraries like `PyPDF2` or `pdfminer`.  
- **Embedding & Indexing**: Uses state-of-the-art embedding models to create vectorized document representations.  
- **Retriever**: Implements nearest-neighbor search using FAISS or similar libraries.  
- **LLM Integration**: Utilizes Hugging Face models like GPT or OpenAI’s API for generation.

### **Future Enhancements**  

- Add support for additional file formats (e.g., Word documents).  
- Implement fine-tuned LLMs for domain-specific queries.  
- Enhance retrieval methods with advanced scoring algorithms.
